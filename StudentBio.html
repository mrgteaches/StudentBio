                <p>I live in Media, Pennsylvania with my wife and six children. My family and I lived in Macedonia, Turkey, and Germany for 14 years, doing Christian work, and only returned to the States about 2 years ago. </p>
        
                <p>My background is in foreign languages and education. I speak French, German, Russian, Turkish, Macedonian, and Romani, and am currently learning Spanish. I love teaching foreign languages and English as a second language; I have taught several languages online to homeschoolers for 8 years now, and am finishing up my master's in TEFL. My BA was in Russian and linguistics.</p>
